# Pronamic Pay - Worldline - Direct - Hosted Checkout

This plugin contains the Pronamic Pay integration for the Worldline Direct Hosted Checkout.

Pronamic Pay connects WordPress and WooCommerce websites with **Worldline**, one of Europe’s leading payment service providers.
This plugin allows merchants to accept payments via **Worldline Direct Hosted Checkout** while maintaining full compatibility with WordPress and WooCommerce updates.

The integration is designed for merchants migrating from legacy payment solutions, including **Ogone** and **Ingenico**, ensuring a smooth transition and continued operation after legacy platforms are discontinued.
It provides a secure, flexible, and future-proof checkout experience while supporting a wide range of payment methods and currencies.

By using Pronamic Pay, WordPress and WooCommerce users can easily integrate Worldline payment services into their websites, manage transactions efficiently, and stay up to date with industry standards.

## Background and History

The **Pronamic Pay – Worldline – Direct – Hosted Checkout** integration builds on a long history of WordPress payment solutions developed by Pronamic for the platform originally known as **Ogone**.

### From Ogone to Ingenico to Worldline

* **Ogone (until around 2013)** – Pronamic developed one of the first WordPress integrations for Ogone’s payment platform, including the well-known `orderstandard.asp` interface.
* **Ingenico ePayments (2013 to 2020)** – After Ogone was acquired by **Ingenico**, the integration continued under the name *Pronamic Pay – Ingenico*. This version of the plugin is available on GitHub:
  [github.com/pronamic/wp-pronamic-pay-ingenico](https://github.com/pronamic/wp-pronamic-pay-ingenico).
* **Worldline (from 2020 onward)** – Ingenico became part of **Worldline**, one of Europe’s leading payment service providers. The original Ogone environment remained available for a period under the names *Worldline | GOPAY* and *Worldline Legacy Solutions*.

Worldline has announced that the legacy Ogone integrations, including the `orderstandard.asp` endpoint, will be **discontinued on December 31, 2025**.
Merchants using the legacy Ogone or Ingenico environments are expected to migrate to a modern Worldline platform such as **Worldline Direct**.

### Worldline Direct – Hosted Checkout Integration

The **Pronamic Pay – Worldline – Direct – Hosted Checkout** plugin was developed as the successor to the earlier Ogone and Ingenico integrations.
It provides a secure, flexible, and future-proof payment experience for WordPress and WooCommerce users.
Through this integration, merchants can process payments via Worldline while maintaining full compatibility with WordPress, WooCommerce, and other Pronamic Pay extensions.
The integration is designed to evolve with updates to both Worldline’s services and the WordPress ecosystem.

### Migration from Ogone or Ingenico to Worldline Direct

Merchants who process payments through the legacy Ogone or Ingenico solutions, such as the `orderstandard.asp` interface or the *GOPAY* platform, can migrate to the **Worldline Direct – Hosted Checkout** integration.
This transition ensures continued operation beyond **December 31, 2025**, and provides access to a modern and secure checkout experience aligned with Worldline’s current payment infrastructure.
